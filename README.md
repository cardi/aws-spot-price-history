# aws-spot-price-history

A collection of scripts to pull the spot pricing history of Amazon Web Services
(AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).

Currently these scripts will pull the history of all available instances' spot
prices and save them to a file. Every execution thereafter will grab only
the updated data.

## Usage

1. Grab the `ec2-api-tools.zip` from Amazon
2. Edit `pull.sh` and replace the environment variables `JAVA_HOME`
   `AWS_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_SECRET_KEY` (or you can put your keys
    in the corresponding files: `aws_access.private` and `aws_secret.private`)
3. Run `pull.sh` and optionally install it in your `crontab`

The first run will grab all possible historic data (90 days, ~25 million
entries, ~2 GB uncompressed) across all 14 regions, so it will take a while.

## Data Format

Data will be stored in files named in the following format:

    data.REGION.YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssÂ±hh:mm

For example:

    data.us-east-1.2017-02-21T00:14:33-08:00
    data.ap-south-1.2017-03-15T15:52:17-07:00

See `ec2-describe-spot-price-history` for the format of the data file itself.

## TODO

* clean, format, and load data points into a time series database
* display graphs
